> Awesome listserves that are open to anyone to join.

I set this list up because I want to find more awesome listserves. 

# Science
* [PublicLab](https://publiclab.org/wiki/mailing-lists): Public Lab is a community and non-profit democratizing science to address environmental issues that affect people.

# Linguistics
* [Linguists Outside of Academia](http://linguistsoutsideacademia.com/): a motley crew of self-identifying linguists with tenuous connections to the groves of academe. This includes trained linguists who are currently out of work, as well as people on shaky fixed-term academic contracts, and others who have 'linguistic' type jobs in non-academic settings. We're here to share ideas about professional life, rejoice in success, commiserate in failure, and generally steer our way through the rolling swells of a tumultuous job market. Run by [@richardlitt](http://richardlitt.github.io/)

# Geography
* [Critical Geography](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=CRIT-GEOG-FORUM): This list provides a forum for the discussion of critical and radical perspectives in geography. Discussions focus on the organisational and disciplinary framework of geographical research and teaching and on critical interpretations of geographical issues. 

# Economy
* [Degrowth-World](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/degrowth-world) This list is for everyone to share announcements and news related to degrowth. The idea is that we use this space to be updated on degrowth activities all over the world. Please join and send any relevant e-mails to the list. Sign up by e-mailing degrowth-world-subscribe@lists.riseup.net

# Hosts

* [Riseup](https://lists.riseup.net/www/): We provide mailing lists for activist organizations.
